# CAN-Based Body Control Module (BCM)

A comprehensive project to implement a **Body Control Module (BCM)** using the **Controller Area Network (CAN)** protocol. This project showcases how to manage various automotive systems like lighting and wipers control in a modular and efficient way.

**>> Problem :** Need for a reliable automotive BCM replica to monitor and control vehicle functions with real-time communication and error detection.

**>> Solution :** Developed a BCM replica using LPC2129 RidoLabz boards and CAN protocol, with a transmitter node managing driver inputs and controlling three receiver nodes.

**>> Implementation :** Demonstrated real-time data exchange, error detection, and multi-node communication for efficient and reliable vehicle electronics management.
